Note
____
The backend work of the project is not done, so the input of the student portal is incomplete( i mean faculty and admin has to input the details of the students, so that the portal would be complete, but due to the lack of time and mismanagement we couldn't able to complete the backend work).

Student Portal Management System – Detailed Description
The Student Portal Management System is a front-end web project created using HTML that simulates a basic educational management platform for three types of users: Students, Faculty, and Administrators. It’s designed to organize, display, and manage academic information through user-specific web pages.

🔹 1. Student Module (Students_portal.html)
This interface is tailored for students to:

Get a personalized welcome based on inputted data (name, department, etc.).

View academic performance: Including subjects, marks, or general progress sections.

Track assignments and quizzes: Students can see what tasks are assigned and upcoming evaluations.

Attendance Information: View attendance percentages or logs.

Submit forms or feedback: Through simple form input elements.

All of this gives the student an overview of their academic life in one place.


🔹 2. Faculty Module (Faculty.html)
This page is designed for teachers to:

Manage student records: Like marking attendance, uploading marks, or viewing student lists.

Upload assignments and quizzes for students to access.

Interact with student data: Depending on how you structured it, the faculty might have form controls to update or filter data.

It acts like a mini control panel for teachers to keep track of classroom activities.

🔹 3. Admin Module (admin2.html)
The admin page provides features like:

Managing user accounts: Adding or removing students and faculty (symbolically since there’s no backend).

Monitoring system logs: View logs related to activity or forms submitted.

Full overview access to both student and faculty pages for supervision.

Admins essentially control the flow and access across the portal.

🔹 4. Login and Navigation Pages
Newlog.html – Acts as a login form mock-up or an entry point to choose the user type.

Homepage.html – The central page that navigates users to their respective modules based on roles.

🛠 Tech Stack & Structure
HTML only: This is a static project with separate HTML files for each user.

No backend/database – All data is manually input through forms or static text.

Ideal for demonstrating UI planning, role-based design, and front-end navigation logic.
