Student Portal Management System â€“ Detailed Description
The Student Portal Management System is a front-end web project created using HTML that simulates a basic educational management platform for three types of users: Students, Faculty, and Administrators. Itâ€™s designed to organize, display, and manage academic information through user-specific web pages.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Student Module (Students_portal.html)
This interface is tailored for students to:

Get a personalized welcome based on inputted data (name, department, etc.).

View academic performance: Including subjects, marks, or general progress sections.

Track assignments and quizzes: Students can see what tasks are assigned and upcoming evaluations.

Attendance Information: View attendance percentages or logs.

Submit forms or feedback: Through simple form input elements.

All of this gives the student an overview of their academic life in one place.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Faculty Module (Faculty.html)
This page is designed for teachers to:

Manage student records: Like marking attendance, uploading marks, or viewing student lists.

Upload assignments and quizzes for students to access.

Interact with student data: Depending on how you structured it, the faculty might have form controls to update or filter data.

It acts like a mini control panel for teachers to keep track of classroom activities.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Admin Module (admin2.html)
The admin page provides features like:

Managing user accounts: Adding or removing students and faculty (symbolically since thereâ€™s no backend).

Monitoring system logs: View logs related to activity or forms submitted.

Full overview access to both student and faculty pages for supervision.

Admins essentially control the flow and access across the portal.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Login and Navigation Pages
Newlog.html â€“ Acts as a login form mock-up or an entry point to choose the user type.

Homepage.html â€“ The central page that navigates users to their respective modules based on roles.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Structure
HTML only: This is a static project with separate HTML files for each user.

No backend/database â€“ All data is manually input through forms or static text.

Ideal for demonstrating UI planning, role-based design, and front-end navigation logic.
